# gtaswitcher
Simple GTA 5 folder switch (between like stock one for ex. GTA Online, and the other one for ex. mods)

Just download the "GTA SWITCH.bat"

You need to have two copies of GTA, the stock one and the other one.
The stock one needs to be called "Grand Theft Auto V"
The other one needs to be called "Grand Theft Auto V MOD"
( YOU CAN CHANGE THAT EDITING THE FILE )

If you use Rockstar as launcher for GTA 5, theorically it's ready to work without editing the file.
Instead if you use any other launcher or you have a custom directory just edit the file.
